## Description
This project is here to make you write your HTTP server. You will be able to test it with a real browser. HTTP is one of the most used protocols on the internet. Knowing its arcane will be useful, even if you wonâ€™t be working on a website.

This project is a group project. Repository contains only parts, which were implemented by myself.

### Implemented parts:
* Config file parser (with [file example](examples/simple.config)).

* Class wrapper for `select()` syscall.
* HTTP header parser.
* All utility functions and classes.
